## Quickstart

To get started with Tic Tac Toe development, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/luloxi/TicTacToe.git
cd TicTacToe
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the contract component or the example ui in the frontend. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
